# gochallenge

The gocha contains caching the orders and subscribing them for inserting in DB.


#### Usage:

First you need to build the project if you want to:

```bash
go build -o bin/main .

# OR

./build.sh
```

Or you can run the project without building anything:

```bash

./run.sh

make serve  # for serving the http server

make subscribe  # for running the subscriber

```
